# Library management system üìù

A library management system is software designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps the librarian maintain the database of new books, the books that members borrow, and their due dates. This system completely automates all your library‚Äôs activities.

# Project submission ‚ú®

This is my project submission for the creation of a Library management system (LIS227)

This code will create a simple Library management system in Python. It uses an SQLite database to store the books in the library. The user can add books to the library, view all the books in the library, and search for books by title or author.

# Set up and Run the code üéó

Clone the repo with the command line:

```
https://github.com/Morenibrahim/Library-management-system.git
```

Then change to the root directory:

```
cd Library-management-system
```

To run this code, you will need to have the Python sqlite3 library installed. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install sqlite3
```

You can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

```
python library.py
```
This will create the library.db database file and then add two books to the library. You can then view all the books in the library by running the code again.
